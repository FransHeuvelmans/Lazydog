# [Bangle 2][1]

[Bangle][1] is a range of hackable smart-watches with some Accelerometer, Heart Rate, and Pedometer sensor features.

Its price is very reasonable, but it can't compete with the sensors of high-end smartwatches. The reason I like to support Bangle is that it is
easy to program (in Javascript only sadly). The user is fully in-control of the data from those sensors, and it doesn't leave the device except when you
explicitly give permission.

## Loading steps

This code makes use of the _sqlite-utils_ package by the same maker as Datasette.

Since it's quite a niche solution I'm using a custom fish-shell script with some python for loading part of it.

Please make a feature-request if you'd like a more usable version of this.
